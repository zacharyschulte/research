## Background
At End to End User Research, I was involved in a project that aimed to compare user preference between different types of audio and video experiences using the clientâ€™s audio and video enhancement integrations. My main role was to perform test moderation.

## Process
We conducted tests with 36 participants using a within-subjects design. We varied the type of experience (audio vs. video) and the device manufacturer as independent variables. We measured user preference as the dependent variable using a Likert scale and open-ended questions. We analyzed the results using statistical tests and visualizations. We also discussed the trends in user preferences with the stakeholders.

## Insights
We found that users did not always prefer the enhanced integration experience over the standard quality experiences. We also learned that user research can be used for more than UX design, it can also inform product decisions and marketing campaigns. We had to consider how our findings would impact the reputation of our client and how they position themselves with their laptop manufacturer partners when communicating these insights.

## Impact
The project provided valuable insights for our client and helped them make informed decisions. It also demonstrated how user research can be used to inform product decisions and marketing campaigns. Our research also helped the client position themselves better with their laptop manufacturer partners.

## Reflection
This project was a great learning experience for me. I improved my skills in user research methodology, moderation techniques, and communication strategies. I faced some challenges in the process and was able to overcome them. I discovered that user research results can be surprising and challenging, and that they are not always straightforward. I also gained confidence and boldness in my role.
