## Background
In January 2023, I led a heuristic evaluation project as part of my role at End to End. The goal was to identify usability issues and provide recommendations for improvement for a B2C energy company's mobile service. The service was designed to offer customers a convenient way to monitor their energy consumption and switch to different plans based on their needs and preferences.

I used Nielsen's 10 heuristics as a guideline, but I also added some additional criteria based on a mobile heuristic checklist I created in practicum during Summer 2022. I conducted the evaluation by myself, using a smartphone and a laptop to access the service and take notes.

## Process
To conduct the heuristic evaluation, I first familiarized myself with the service and the design elements. I then applied Nielsen's 10 heuristics to evaluate the interface and functionality of the service. I used a smartphone and a laptop to access the service and take notes. After the evaluation, I categorized and prioritized the issues based on their severity and frequency.

I also customized the existing report template to make it more concise and relevant. I removed unnecessary sections or combined similar ones. I also added some visual elements such as screenshots, diagrams, and charts to make it more appealing and easy to understand.

## Insights
I found more than 100 issues and suggestions for improvement. Some of them were minor, such as typos or inconsistent icons, but others were more serious, such as confusing navigation or lack of feedback. To communicate my findings and recommendations to the client, I applied the Pyramid Principle, which is a communication technique that allows you to structure your points and arguments properly. It starts with asking for what you want, and explaining why you want it.

## Impact
The client appreciated my report and presentation skills. They agreed with most of my recommendations and expressed their interest in implementing them. The project was successful, as it resulted in improved user satisfaction, retention, and conversion rates.

## Reflection
One of the main challenges that I faced in this project was communication with the client. To overcome this challenge, I used the Pyramid Principle to structure my points and arguments, which improved the clarity and impact of my communication. I also learned a lot about report writing and formatting, as I had to customize the existing template to make it more concise and relevant. Overall, I am proud of the outcome of this project and the impact it had on the client's business.
