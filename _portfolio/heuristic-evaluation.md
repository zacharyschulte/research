## Background
At End to End, I led a project for a client's B2C web application, designed to empower customers by monitoring their energy usage and seamlessly switching electricity plans. The client wanted me to identify usability issues and thereby enhance the user experience, while fostering a culture of energy conservation through informed choices. They needed results quickly: I only had three weeks to go through each page of the web application and summarize the key problems in a report. Understanding the need for a swift, cost-effective method, I chose heuristic evaluation for this project.

## Process
To get started, I held a kick-off meeting with the client and their designer to define project goals and expectations. They provided a wealth of environmental context, which I took into consideration when customizing the list of criteria and carrying out the evaluation. To further inform the evaluation, I also surveyed the stakeholders on their experience of the service, to gain complementary, qualitative insights. Using three predetermined evaluation scenarios as a guide, I deeply immersed myself in the service, recording observations along the way.

For the evaluation, I expanded Nielsen’s 10 Heuristics by integrating specific criteria for mobile usability, a strategy I previously applied during a heuristic evaluation of AllState's mobile interface. This extra layer of criteria was introduced to cater to distinctive mobile user behaviors, expectations, and ergonomics. I interacted with the service on both smartphone and laptop devices to ensure a comprehensive evaluation.

While recording my interactions, I took copious notes of every instance of a heuristic violation: lack of visibility of system status, lack of user control, ambiguous or inconsistent language, etc. Upon concluding each user flow, I ranked the usability issues based on their severity and recurrence, ensuring the most significant problems received due attention. Before building the report, I conducted a debriefing call with the stakeholders to discuss my findings and present a preliminary list of problems.

One major hurdle was the difficulty in communicating with the client, which initially hindered me from obtaining sample account usernames and passwords for the service. However, I circumvented this by signing up for the service myself. This proactive approach allowed me to maintain the project's momentum and carry out the evaluation without further delays. By the time the client had provided the requested information, I had already compiled most of the results.

## Insights
I identified over 100 usability issues across the entire user journey – from onboarding all the way to plan purchasing. Insights uncovered issues related to information hierarchy, form design, navigation, and more. I developed practical solutions for each problem to enhance the user experience on both desktop and mobile platforms.

The recommendations I made for the client were mostly focused on making the website more intuitive for the user, by introducing clearer and more concise design elements. I suggested a combination of changes including, but not limited to, the following:

* Adding a clear call to action on the homepage
* Making the behavior of buttons and tooltips more consistent
* Reducing cognitive load by introducing simpler navigation
* Adding feedback for users after completing tasks

While I can't share everything I found here, I think the most emblematic issue was related to the first step of the user journey: Starting an account. The client's original homepage lacked information about the service, as well as a clear signup path.

A good presentation, like a good story, needs to be engaging and clear. In my presentation, I kept the spotlight on the critical issues, discussing how addressing them would improve the user experience. Detailed recommendations for all issues were provided, but for the critical ones, I crafted wireframes to vividly demonstrate the proposed changes.

Furthermore, I emphasized the need of a follow-up study with real-user usability tests, because genuine feedback from end users can't be replaced by expert opinions.

## Impact
The client found my insights valuable for improving their web application interface and for developing a native mobile app prototype. They appreciated the comprehensive report providing actionable recommendations, with minimal implementation time and effort. They also endorsed my suggestion to conduct usability testing with real users on their mobile app prototype before launch.

## Reflection
Turning roadblocks into stepping stones — that's what this project was all about. Communicating effectively with the client was a challenge, but the Pyramid Principle proved to be a powerful tool for expressing complex findings. This strategy ensured concise communication, starting with the key takeaway, followed by supporting arguments, and then detailed evidence. I applied this principle not just in the report but also to project update emails, ensuring the client was consistently engaged and informed throughout the project. Despite initial hiccups, I was able to deliver the project on time with valuable recommendations.
