## Background
This was a diary study commissioned by a laptop manufacturer client to explore how people use technology in their everyday lives. The study was conducted over a period of time, with 49 participants from six different user personas recruited and managed through the Indeemo platform. My role in this project was mainly focused on participant communication, data preparation, and qualitative analysis.

## Process
The study had an exploratory nature, meaning that the participants were not given specific tasks or scenarios, but rather asked open-ended questions about their technology habits and preferences. My work mainly involved emailing participants regularly to remind them to complete their daily entries, and answering any questions they had about the study. I also exported the data from Indeemo, which included text, audio, video, and image responses from the participants. I cleaned and organized the data for analysis using Visual Studio Code, Python, and Regex, and wrote some scripts to automate some of the repetitive tasks.

For the qualitative analysis, I developed a unique process for conducting thematic coding and content analysis of the data, using a combination of manual and automated methods. I used tools such as Excel to code the responses based on themes and categories that emerged from the data. I also used some natural language processing techniques such as topic modeling and summarization algorithms, though I found that these techniques were not very effective for this type of data.

## Insights
The key findings from the diary study were that technology use varies across different user personas and contexts. We also found that Indeemo had an unintuitive interface and limited functionality for diary studies, which led to some difficulties for the participants. We highlighted these issues and suggested ways to improve the user experience. We also recommended that regular communication with the participants should be maintained, and clear instructions and expectations should be provided to motivate them and ensure high-quality data.

I presented our findings to stakeholders and designers in the form of a "pseudo-report" that summarized the main takeaways of the study. I had to balance between providing enough detail and specificity to support the findings, but not too much that would overwhelm or bore the client. I also had to avoid making generalizations or assumptions based on the data, but rather highlight novel situations or examples that illustrated the findings.

## Impact
The insights from the diary study were used to inform the design decisions and solutions for the client. They received positive feedback from users and the business, and their product development and design decisions were improved as a result.

## Reflection
This project was a valuable learning experience for me, as I got to apply and improve my skills in diary study design, participant communication, data preparation, qualitative analysis, and report writing. I also learned a lot about how people use technology in their everyday lives. I think that the project provided useful insights and recommendations for our client, and that it had a positive impact on their product development and design decisions.
