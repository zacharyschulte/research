## Background
A laptop manufacturer wanted our team to conduct a diary study that investigated people's use of technology in their daily lives. They wanted to understand the role of laptops in users' routines and discover opportunities to fulfill their needs and preferences. They had identified 6 user personas based on previous market research, and they asked us to recruit 10 participants for each persona. We had several months to collect data, analyze it, and present our findings. As lead research assistant, I ensured effective communication with participants, prepared data, and implemented a novel qualitative analysis process. I delivered our key recommendations directly to the client.

## Process
Since this study was exploratory in nature, the participants were not given specific scenarios, but rather asked 27 open-ended questions about their technology habits and preferences. The participants used a diary study app, Indeemo, to share videos and images of their technology use for four weeks. We divided the participants into three phases, so that each group started and ended at different times.

My role in the early stage of the project was to communicate with the participants regularly. The participants varied a lot in their demographics, tech usage, and personality. Some were more engaged and expressive, while others were reluctant and brief. I checked on their progress and provided them with reminders, feedback, and encouragement to keep them engaged and motivated. I also assisted them with Indeemo-related issues.

The diary study lasted for three months and gave me more than 1900 entries to examine. I realized that I needed a novel process to make sense of all the data, and to find the key themes and patterns that would provide valuable insight for our client. I started by exporting the data from Indeemo, which had text, audio, video, and image responses from the participants. I used Visual Studio Code, Python, and Regex to clean and organize the data for analysis, and wrote some scripts to automate some of the tedious tasks.

For the qualitative analysis, I created a unique process for doing thematic coding and content analysis of the data, using a mix of manual and automated methods. I wanted to know the overall themes from the participant responses. I used some natural language processing techniques such as topic modeling and summarization algorithms on the participant video transcripts. This showed me some interesting insights about how the personas were similar and different, but these techniques were not very useful for this type of data. 

Instead, I applied traditional qualitative methods of content analysis and thematic coding. I used tools like Excel to code the responses based on themes and categories that came from the data. I also taught the analysis process to two other people who helped me analyze the responses. I emphasized the difference between findings and takeaways: findings are descriptions of the important themes, unique observations, and behavioral/attitudinal patterns based on what we learned from participantsâ€™ responses, and takeaways are practical suggestions based on the findings that help our client improve their products based on what their customers or potential customers want.

## Insights
Our client had very specific needs for the analysis: they wanted us to identify trends, but not to be too general in our summaries. They also wanted us to point out any unique findings and include as much context about the participants as possible. To do this, I trained our team to analyze the responses by participant persona instead of task. This allowed us to better meet the client's needs and provide more detailed summaries. We were able to identify trends and unique findings specific to each persona. I shared these user persona documents in one-on-one meetings with the client, telling the story of how each persona used technology in their lives.

After several rounds of analysis, I identified the main themes and patterns that emerged from the data. I worked with our client to understand their needs and the kinds of insights they were looking for. To provide an effective overview of the most interesting themes, I applied a technique called pattern mining. This allowed us to quickly identify the key trends and patterns, then organize them into categories. We used these categories to provide a comprehensive overview to our client, including key findings, trends, and recommendations from the diary study.

## Impact
Our results delighted the client. They felt that the persona analysis documents helped them empathize with the participants. They liked how I collaborated with them on interpreting the data. The insights we provided were useful and relevant to the client's product strategy. The client applied our findings to their product roadmap and design decisions, and requested a follow-up study.

## Reflection
This project was a great learning experience. I had to be very organized and creative in designing the analysis process, and I had to stay focused and on top of the data at all times. I was also able to practice my presentation and communication skills by presenting our findings directly to the client. The project was also satisfying because we were able to make an impact on the client's business. I was proud to be part of such an impactful project, and I believe it has prepared me to take on similar challenges in the future.

If I had less time, I would have to prioritize the most important tasks and streamline the analysis process. I would focus on the key insights that the client needs, rather than trying to analyze all the data. Additionally, I would work closely with the client to set expectations and deadlines, so that we could ensure that the most important tasks are completed.
