## Background
Our team had a problem: We weren’t sure if our new leads were understanding what long-time users liked most about our service. We were seeing confused customers, which often led to churn. In order to reduce churn, we wanted to align our company’s messaging and product priorities with the voice of the customer. 

To do this, we used user segmentation tools within Intercom to create two segments of users: one of long-time users and one of potential leads. We then used an Inherent Value Test, a simple usability testing technique that measures how a site communicates its product’s inherent value. We held contextual inquiry observational research sessions with our long-time users and had potential leads walk us through our marketing landing page.

## Process
We used a behavior count matrix to track patterns of use among the long-time users. We then added all relevant feedback to our Product Feedback Database and created a presentation with our recommendations.

## Insights
We discovered gaps in our messaging where features that long-time users favored were not communicated to potential customers. We also uncovered patterns that may have led leads to abandon their cart. We had clear insight about what features users found valuable and were able to communicate this to our marketing and product teams.

## Impact
After implementing our recommendations, we saw an uptick in conversions. Our research had successfully aligned the goals of our company with the voice of the customer.

## Reflection
This project was a great example of how research can be used to understand customer needs and inform design decisions. We had to be creative in our methods and use multiple techniques to uncover the information we needed. We also had to take care to ensure our findings were presented in a way that was both informative and engaging. Overall, we are proud of the impact our research had on the project and the business.
